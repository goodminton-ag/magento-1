## Related projects
Related projects can provide additional features and perks that can't be included in the main package for various reasons. These projects are not officially supported by BS PAYONE and can cause unexpected changes in module behavior. Support, if any, is given in the respective projects alone:

* [Pragmatic-Apps/magento1-payone-postponecapture](https://github.com/Pragmatic-Apps/magento1-payone-postponecapture): Provides automatic capture when an order is shipped for Payolution payment methods.

* [Pragmatic-Apps/magento1-payone-restrictproducts](https://github.com/Pragmatic-Apps/magento1-payone-restrictproducts): Extension that allows to automatically disable selected methods when certain products are in the shopping cart. This is necessary to comply with requirements of some payment provides (e.g. when it is not allowed to sell coupons).
